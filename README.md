# GeneticAlgorithmTest

This was an old project that was to help understand genetic algorithms and how they function. 
This example assumes that there is a genetic sequence that is the target, but
it is easy to change this to test after a fitness test is performed for the item.

I know I had help from a website on this project but I am unsure of the url as this is an old project.
